											<h3> Data Analyst and Scientist </h3>
											<p>About Me</p>
										</header>
										<p>I am a Boston based data scientist with a background in economics and nearly a decade of experience in project management, purchasing, and vendor relations. <br>I have worked with creative teams, clients, and manufacturers to create products that fit with our client’s brand aesthetics as well as their profitability and scheduling expectations. <br>

I am passionate about using data, predictive modelling, and machine learning to improve efficiencies in inventory, sales, and logistics operations. <br>
I am very excited for the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with other data scientists to develop data science and machine learning solutions to real-world problems. </p>

											<h3>AI in Dermatology</h3>
											<p>Facilitated process for validation of spot diagnosis of over 2,000 images and used CV2 and clustering models for the creation and classification of a racially inclusive image dataset for identification and diagnosis of skin conditions through machine learning techniques, including generative adversarial networks and auto machine learning.</p>

											<h3>Predicting Cancellations of Hotel Reservations</h3>
											<p>Built random forest model, resulting in 81.6% accuracy in predicting cancellations of hotel bookings based on data from over 100,000 hotel reservations, including details on the timing of the reservations and market segment of the guests.</p>

											<h3>COVID-19 and US State Clustering by Aggregate Smartphone Movement </h3>
											<p>Used k means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment US states by device exposure index, resulting in clusters exhibiting similar aggregate Smartphone movements through commercial spaces for greater understanding of state level exposure and response to shelter-in-place orders</p>

											<h3>Money and Presidential Nominees for US Ambassador</h3>
											<p>Examined data set with over 33,000 data points on the qualifications and experience of US career ambassador nominees, nominated between 1981 and 2018, to determine whether there is a statistically significant correlation between the size of personal financial contributions from nominees to their nominating president’s party or campaigns.</p>
